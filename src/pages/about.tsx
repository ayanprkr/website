                        Hi, I&apos;m Ayan, also known as <span className="font-semibold text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-500 to-sky-500 bg-clip-text">MetalOoze</span>.
                        I&apos;m from and currently residing in Mumbai, India. I&apos;m also a full-stack developer who care about performant, accessible code. 
                        I&apos;m a huge fan of maintaining and contributing open source repositories.
                        <br /><br />
                        I started programming back in 2020 when I was in 10th grade while everyone was stuck in the pandemic. I had a great opportunity to learn something new as I had a lot of time during the pandemic.
                        <br />
                        Initially I used to code basic Discord Bots (most of the code copied from github or stackoverflow) but later on I tried making a Bot myself and was able to code without any external help lol!
                        <br /><br />
                        In 2021, I started <span className="font-semibold text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-500 to-sky-500 bg-clip-text">Web Development</span> but this time I was able to code without any help ðŸ˜Ž.
                        <br />
                        Later on I found out that web development is not just about HTML/CSS so I started learning React and made my first React website <span className="underline"><Link href="https://www.metalooze.xyz/" target="_blank">metalooze.xyz</Link></span>
                        <br /><br />
                        Before programming, I was also a Graphic Designer so yeah thats why my designs are so cool!
